### 🧩 Chapter 75: Breaking the Silence

In Chapter 75, the atmosphere is heavy. Kim Dan, worn out emotionally and physically, is seen struggling with his own thoughts. The silence between him and Jaekyung feels louder than ever.

#### 🔹 Key Moments:

* Dan appears distant, clearly battling inner conflict.
* Jaekyung notices the change but reacts awkwardly — unsure of how to handle it.
* There's a moment where Jaekyung seems to hesitate, showing a sliver of concern.

➡️ This chapter is less about dialogue and more about what's **not** being said. Eye contact, hesitation, and body language build a sense of rising tension.

### 🎭 Chapter 76: A Glimpse of Change

In Chapter 76, the pacing slows down, giving both characters time to reflect. Jaekyung’s cold exterior shows signs of softening, while Dan remains cautious.

#### 🔹 Key Moments:

* A quiet scene between the two hints at growing mutual awareness.
* Dan starts to speak more honestly, although guarded.
* Jaekyung, for once, listens — not perfectly, but he tries.

➡️ The dynamic begins to shift. There’s no full resolution, but there’s **progress** — subtle, emotional, and genuine.
